# AWS

## Overview

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing resources — including storage, processing power, databases, networking, analytics, artificial intelligence, and software applications — over the internet.
By outsourcing these resources, companies can access the computational assets they need, when they need them, without needing to purchase and maintain a physical, on-premise IT infrastructure.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers many services for cloud computing and is as of 2024 the biggest [cloud service provider](<https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/cloud-service-providers/#:~:text=1.,%2Da%2DService%20(IaaS)>)

In my GitHub repository I will be showcasing all of my recent projects that I have worked on and to excel my experience with the different AWS products and services to be a future reference for me as a Cloud Engineer.
