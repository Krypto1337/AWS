# AWS

## Overview

Overview
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing resources — including storage, processing power, databases, networking, analytics, artificial intelligence, and software applications — over the internet. By outsourcing these resources, companies can access the computational assets they need when they need them, without having to purchase and maintain a physical, on-premises IT infrastructure.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers many services for cloud computing and, as of 2024, is the largest [cloud service provider](<https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/cloud-service-providers/#:~:text=1.,%2Da%2DService%20(IaaS)>).

In my GitHub repository, I will showcase all of my recent projects that I have worked on to enhance my experience with the different AWS products and services. This repository will serve as a future reference for me as a Cloud Engineer.
